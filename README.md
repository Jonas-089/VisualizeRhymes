## Visualize Rhymes
A little project aiming to visualize simple rhymes in the English language with PyQT5.
Might have been inspired by the Rap Genius video series [Check The Rhyme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VNHp_flJKE).

## Demo
Here are a few Screenshots showing what the project does. This is the standard user dialog:

You can choose between two examples or write your own rhyme. The program calculates the rhymes and returns them in a two dimensional array with the same numbers representing the same rhyme. It then assigns colors to the rhymes and displays them in a window. In the example above, this would be:

Here is a more complicated example using the opening lines of Eminem's Lose Yourself:
